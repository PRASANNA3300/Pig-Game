# Pig-Game
The Pig-Game project is a digital version of the classic dice game, built using JavaScript. Two players take turns rolling a dice to accumulate points, choosing to 'Hold' to secure their score or risk rolling again. Rolling a 1 resets the current turn's score. The first player to reach 100 points wins. This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and event handling while providing an interactive gaming experience.
